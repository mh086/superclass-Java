# superclass-Java
Implement a superclass Person. Make two classes, Student and Instructor, that inherit from Person. 
A person has a name and a year of birth. A student has a major, and an instructor has a salary. Write 
the class declarations, the constructors, and the methods toString for all classes. Supply a test program 
that tests these classes and methods.
